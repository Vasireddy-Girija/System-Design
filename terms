reliability - Any uploaded tet/image/video should never be lost.
consistency - Not being able to read the latest write.
redundancy - Having multiple services to do the same thing. At any point, we might need one server, even though others don't serve any
              traffic, they are there so that failover can happen when the server serving traffic fails/degrades. 
              Redundancy helps in avoiding single point of failure, to increase availability.
